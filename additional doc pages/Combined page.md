metadataTitle: "Getting Started Success Checklist for Adapty Initial Integration and Configuration"
---

## Text

Adapty integrates with your mobile app on three levels: in the Adapty Dashboard, in the app stores, and in your mobile app code.

It's important to note that the initial installation and configuration process varies between the Apple App Store and Google Play Store.

<!----->

While the initial installation and configuration may seem like a preliminary step, we highly recommend pausing after this stage to verify the results against our recommendations. This ensures any potential errors are easily identified before proceeding to the next stage.

## Callouts

### Danger

:::danger
Go through release checklist before releasing your app

Before releasing your application, make sure to carefully review the [Release Checklist](https://docs.adapty.io/docs/release-checklist) thoroughly. This checklist ensures that you've completed all necessary steps and provides criteria for evaluating the success of your integration.
:::

### Info

:::note
This section refers to [Observer mode](observer-vs-full-mode) only. If you do not work in Observer mode, refer to the [Android - Present Paywall Builder paywalls](android-present-paywalls) topic instead.
:::

### Warning 

:::warning
Don't forget to [Associate paywalls to purchase transactions](associate-paywalls-to-transactions). Otherwise, Adapty will not determine the source paywall of the purchase.

## Table in block with paragraphs inside

| Issue | Solution |
|-----|--------|
| An error is returned in the mobile app | Refer to the error list for your platform: [for iOS](ios-sdk-error-handling), [for Android](android-sdk-error-handling), [for Flutter, React Native, or Unity](error-handling-on-flutter-react-native-unity) and follow our recommendations to resolve the issue. |
| Transaction is absent from the **Event Feed** although no error is returned in the mobile app | <p>1\. for iOS: Ensure you use a real device rather than a simulator.</p><p>2. Ensure that the `Bundle ID`/`Package name` of your app matches the one in the [**App settings**](https://app.adapty.io/settings/general).</p><p>3. Ensure the `PUBLIC_SDK_KEY` in your app matches the **Public SDK key** in the Adapty Dashboard: [**App settings**-> **General** tab -> **API keys** subsection](https://app.adapty.io/settings/general).</p> |
| No event is present in my testing profile | <p>A new user profile record is automatically created in Adapty in the following cases:</p><p></p><p>- When a user runs your app for the first time</p><p>- When a user logs out of your app</p><p></p><p>All transactions and events in a chain are tied to the profile that generated the first transaction. This helps keep the entire transaction history, including trial periods, subscription purchases, renewals, and more linked to the same profile. This means that a new profile record that generated a subsequent translation - we call it a non-original profile - may not have any events associated with it but will retain the granted access level. In some cases, you'll also see "access_level_updated" events here. It's advised to ignore these new, empty profiles and focus on the original ones for a clearer view of the user's transaction history.</p><p></p><p>This behavior is more prominent for testing scenarios but also normal for production. It should not be treated as a bug or SDK misconfiguration.In order to run the test with only one profile and have fun concise history in one place, create a new test account (Sandbox Apple ID) each time you reinstall the mobile app.</p><p></p><p>Please see an example of a non-original profile under the table. For more details on profile creation, please see [Profile record creation](profiles-crm#profile-record-creation).</p> |
| Prices do not reflect the actual prices set in App Store Connect | <p>In both Sandbox and TestFlight which uses the sandbox environment for in-app purchases, it's important to verify that the purchase flow functions correctly, rather than focusing on the accuracy of prices. It's worth noting that Apple's API can occasionally provide inaccurate data, particularly when different regions are configured for devices or accounts. And since the prices come directly from the Store and the Adapty backend does not affect purchase prices in any way, you can ignore any inaccuracy in prices during the testing of the purchases through Adapty.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, prioritize testing the purchase flow itself over the accuracy of prices to ensure it functions as intended.</p> |
| The transaction time in the **Event Feed** is incorrect | The **Event Feed** uses the time zone set in the **App Settings**. To align the time zone of events with your local time, adjust the **Reporting timezone** in [**App settings** -> **General** tab](https://app.adapty.io/settings/general). |
