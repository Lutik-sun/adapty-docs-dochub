Offers in the App Store and Google Play are special deals or discounts provided by these platforms for in-app purchases.

To make an offer visible and selectable within a [paywall](https://docs.adapty.io/docs/paywalls) for your app's users, follow these steps:

1. While [configuring the products on a paywall](paywalls#create-a-paywall), click the **Add offer** button next to the product the offer belongs to. The button is available only for the products that have offers.

   
<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>

    style={{ width: '70%', border: '1px solid grey' }}
  />
</div>



2. Select an offer you [created earlier](create-offer) for this product from the **Offer** list.

</div>
