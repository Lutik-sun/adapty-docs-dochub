---

Every [Product](products) requires an associated access level to ensure that users receive the corresponding gated content upon purchase. Adapty seamlessly determines the subscription duration, which then serves as the expiration date for the access level. In the case of a lifetime product, if a customer purchases it, the access level remains perpetually active without any expiration date.

To link an access level to a product:

1. While [configuring a product](create-product), select the access level from the **Access Level ID** list.


<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
  <img 
    src="https://files.readme.io/e71651e-add_access_level_to_product.png" 
    style={{ width: '700px', border: '1px solid grey' }}
  />
</div>





2. Click the **Save** button to confirm the change.
