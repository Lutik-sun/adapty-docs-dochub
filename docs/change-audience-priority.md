When you have different user audiences in one [placement](placements), a user can belong to more than one audience. For instance, if you've defined audiences like "Female", "Runners", and a general audience like "All users," it's crucial to determine which specific audience to consider first when a user falls into multiple categories.

</div>





In this scenario, we rely on audience priority. Audience priority is a numerical order, where #1 is the highest. It guides the sequence for audiences to check. In simpler terms, audience priority helps Adapty make decisions about which audience to apply first when selecting the paywall or A/B test to display. If the audience priority for a paywall or A/B test is low, users who potentially qualify for the paywall or test might bypass it. Instead, they could be directed to another audience with a higher priority.

To adjust audience priorities for a placement:

1. Open the **[Placements](https://app.adapty.io/placements)** section from the Adapty main menu.
2. Click the placement for which you want to change the audience priority.
