Event feed allows you to visually track [Events](events) generated by Adapty and check the status of their export to 3rd-party integrations, including the webhook. Please note that [transactions generated with server-side API](server-side-api-specs#transaction) do not appear in the **Event Feed**.

:::note
AppsFlyer, Facebook Ads, and Branch sending status could be inaccurate because they do not always return errors when they occur.
