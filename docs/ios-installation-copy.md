Adapty offers two essential SDKs for seamless integration into your mobile app:

- **The primary Adapty SDK**: This is a foundational, obligatory SDK required for the operation of Adapty within your app.
- **AdaptyUI SDK**: This additional SDK is essential if you plan to use the Paywall Builder. The [Paywall Builder](paywall-builder-getting-started) is a convenient, user-friendly tool designed for a no-code approach. It empowers you to effortlessly create a subscription or other virtual product purchase page, known as a [Paywall](paywalls) in Adapty. This approach ensures seamless integration of paywalls directly into your iOS or Android apps as native layout pages.  
  The Adapty Paywall Builder is crafted to streamline the setup of core conversion-driving elements of paywalls with just a few clicks in the dashboard, eliminating the need to spend time on minor design tweaks and technical configurations. It also enables you to edit your paywall's native layout on the go by making visual changes in the Adapty web interface.  

Please refer to the compatibility table below to select the appropriate pair of Adapty SDK and AdaptyUI SDK.

| Adapty SDK version | AdaptyUI SDK version |
| :----------------- | :------------------- |
| 2.7.x, 2.8.x       | 2.0.x                |
