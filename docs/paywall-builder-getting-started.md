You can create paywalls faster and easier using Adapty paywall builder and get them directly in your iOS or Android apps as native layout pages. 

We've analyzed dozens of paywalls and created a solution that allows you together with [Adapty A/B tests](https://docs.adapty.io/docs/ab-test) to check the most valuable hypotheses quickly. 

The builder is created to set the core conversion-driving elements of paywalls with several clicks in the dashboard without spending time on minor design amendments and technical settings. It helps also to edit your paywall native layout on the fly by changing it visually in the Adapty web interface.

To use the paywall builder you need to initially set the SDK part just once. Please follow the articles below to do so.

1. [Installation](https://docs.adapty.io/docs/paywall-builder-installation)
2. [Fetching Paywalls & ViewConfiguration](https://docs.adapty.io/docs/paywall-builder-fetching)
3. [Presenting Visual Paywalls](https://docs.adapty.io/docs/paywall-builder-presenting)
4. [Handling Visual Paywall Events](https://docs.adapty.io/docs/paywall-builder-events) 

When everything is set on the SDK side you can use just the Adapty dashboard to create paywalls using paywall builder, edit them, run tests with them, etc.

### Paywall builder in the dashboard

Adapty paywall builder works as an optional supplement to [the main flow of handling paywalls](https://docs.adapty.io/docs/paywall) so you may switch it off/on when needed with a toggle.
