Begin configuring the Adapty paywall builder by installing the [Adapty Unity SDK](unity-installation). Note that the AdaptyUI SDK is necessary only if you intend to use the paywalls created with the Paywall Builder.

The SDK uses the "External Dependency Manager" plugin to handle iOS Cocoapods dependencies and Android gradle dependencies. After the installation you may need to invoke the dependency manager

`Assets -> External Dependency Manager -> Android Resolver -> Force Resolve`

and

`Assets -> External Dependency Manager -> iOS Resolver -> Install Cocoapods`

When building your Unity project for iOS, you would get `Unity-iPhone.xcworkspace` file, which you have to open instead of `Unity-iPhone.xcodeproj`, otherwise Cocoapods dependencies won't be used.
