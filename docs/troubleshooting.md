There are some expected limitations where an element can or cannot be moved and placed, for example:

- The footer cannot be moved. This means you cannot move it between layers and cannot change its position on the layout, it's always at the bottom of the paywall.
- The hero image is always on the back layer.
- A random element cannot be moved to the middle of a list or a product block, etc.



When you drag an element through the list, you always see if you can drop it in the place it's above. The purple line shows the available position. Red - inaccessible.


<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>

    style={{ width: '700px', border: '1px solid grey' }}
  />
</div>
