Adapty SDK has its own wrapper for all kinds of errors, called `AdaptyError`. Basically, every error returned by an SDK is `AdaptyError`. It has two useful properties: `originalError` and `adaptyErrorCode`, described below.

## originalError

It contains an original error in case you need the original one to work with. Can be [SKError](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/skerror), [NSError](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nserror) or just general Swift [Error](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/error). This property is optional since some errors can be generated directly by SDK, like inconsistent or missing data, and won't have the original error around which the wrapper was initially built.

## adaptyErrorCode

This one can be used to handle common issues, like:

- invalid credentials
- network errors
- cancelled payments
- billing issues
- invalid receipt
- and much more

It's pretty easy to check the error for specific codes and react to them accordingly.

```swift title="Swift"
Adapty.makePurchase(product: product) { result in
    if result.error?.adaptyErrorCode == .paymentCancelled {
        // purchase was cancelled
        // you can offer discount to your user or remind them later
    }
}
```

## Most common errors and how to handle them

### StoreKit errors

#### AdaptyErrorеCode.paymentCancelled

Corresponds to [`SKError.Code.paymentCancelled`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/skerror/code/paymentcancelled).

**Issue:**  
User cancelled their purchase and was not charged.

**Workaround:**  
No action required, but in terms of the business logic, you can offer a discount to your user or remind them later.

##### AdaptyErrorCode.cantReadReceipt

**Issue:**  
There is no valid receipt available on the device. Can be an issue during sandbox testing.

**Workaround:**  
In the sandbox, you won't have a valid receipt file until you actually make a purchase, so make sure you did one before accessing it. During sandbox testing also make sure you signed in on a device with a valid Apple sandbox account.

##### AdaptyErrorCode.invalidOfferIdentifier

Corresponds to [`SKError.Code.invalidOfferIdentifier`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/skerror/code/invalidofferidentifier).

**Issue:**  
The offer [`identifier`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/skpaymentdiscount/3043528-identifier) is not valid. For example, you have not set up an offer with that identifier in the App Store, or you have revoked the offer.

**Workaround:**  
Make sure you set up desired offers in AppStore connect and pass a valid offer identifier.
