In Observer mode, the Adapty SDK lacks the ability to determine the source of purchases. If you use our [Paywalls](paywalls) or [A/B Tests](ab-test) to showcase products, you'll need to manually assign variations to purchases to view metrics in the Adapty Dashboard. Follow our framework-specific instructions to enable A/B test analytics:

- [iOS - Observer mode](ios-observer-mode)
- [Android - Observer mode](android-observer-mode)
- [Flutter – Observer mode](flutter-observer-mode)
- [React Native — Observer mode](react-native-observer-mode)
- [Unity – Observer mode](unity-observer-mode)
